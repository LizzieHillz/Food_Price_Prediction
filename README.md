# 🧠 Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the price of items based on provided features using regression techniques. The project was developed using a Jupyter Notebook, with steps including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict product prices using features such as category, weight, quantity, etc.
- **Dataset:** A CSV file containing sample data related to products (e.g., name, price, weight, quantity, etc.)
- **Model Used:** Linear Regression
- **Evaluation Metric:** R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## 🧱 Workflow Summary

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Removed irrelevant columns
   - Handled null values
   - Converted data types
   - Encoded categorical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Plotted correlation heatmaps
   - Visualized relationships between variables

3. **Model Training:**
   - Used `train_test_split` to divide the dataset
   - Trained a Linear Regression model
   - Evaluated with R² Score and MSE

4. **Model Performance:**
   - R² Score: *Displayed in notebook*
   - MSE: *Displayed in notebook*

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
